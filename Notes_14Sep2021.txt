Javascript
	2 days to learn javascript
	1 day to prepare for javascript exam
	Friday we have javascript test

------------------------------
What is javascript?
	is a client side script language

What is client side?
	we are going top create web pages now.

	A web page contains HTML code.
	A web page also can contain scripts. That makes a web page a dynamic web page.

	Ex:
		I can display Time in the webpage using HTML code.
		This time will remain same time forever. That is static code done in HTML

		Now, i display time using a javascript program. It is possible to display live time using dynamic 			code

		But which time will be displayed by the javascript program?

		dynamic aspect in a web page is anything like ability to 
			calculate
			validate
			compute
				or simple execute a code and produce output. That is dynamic

		2+3
			2+3 is printed as 3 characters

		2+3	becomes 5
			how?		it is because of calculation or computation

			that ability to produce output is dynamic aspect.

		HTML cannot produce dynamic output.

		So we learn javascript.
			

		We display time using javascript code, but which time will be displayed?
		
		We are accessing www.facebook.com

			suppose, facebook displays the time, which time will be displayed?

		facebook web pages are not present in our computer. They are present in "SERVER"
		by accessing the webpages, we become "CLIENT"

		now if time is displayed by a javascript program, then our (client) computer's time will be displayed
		because, javascript programs run in client computer (browser)

		javascript programs are not executed at server. They are executed in the client machine's browser.
		So javascript is a client side script language
		-----------------------------------------------

Overview:
---------
	Any idea? what is the latest version of javascript?
		Javascript ES6

	previous version was ES5

	ES stands for ECMA Script
	ECMA stands for European Computer Manufaturers' Association


Advantages:
-----------
	Javascript runs in clients' browser and hence the response will be faster (when compared to server side 		scripts)

	For example:
		if the username and password textboxes are empty, then the submit button should not be enabled.
		This can be done in javascript. It is not required to do it in server side scripts like servlets/jsp
		
	It reduces network traffic. Because, no need to reach the server

	Good user experience like drag and drop, mouse move events, focus, blur, keyUp events for user experience

	RIA		Rich Internet Applications

	NO NEED TO INSTALL anything in clients machine.

	Language, is also easy to learn like c, c++, java languages
	
Limitations:
-----------
	since javascript runs in client machine, it cannot access server side resources.(But AJAX is used to do that)

	some browser settings can prevent javascript from running

	cannot access database. The database is present in server only. NOT IN EVERY CLIENT.

Lets start using visual studio code


You may create a separate javascript file using .js extension
You may embed javascript code inside a HTML file		(first we do like that)
	<head>
	</head>
	<body>
	</body>

where shall i write javascript code?
	head (or) body?

If you write js code in <head>
	then it is loaded even before the web page body is displayed in the browser.
	so it is always recommended to write js code in <head> part

No. If the body is dependent on javscript code, then if js code is below or in bottom, then the functionality is not available.

Loading the js code before the page is rendered is good for performance.

Advantage of having js code in body is
	the js code will be able to access all the elements since they are available 

There are advantages in both ways also

<script>
</script>
	this tag is used to write javascript code in a html page

Lets do a hello world program now!

<script>
        alert('hello world');
</script>

The alert is actually
	window.alert('hi');

This code is executed when the page is loaded
------------------but

<script>
        function fn1()
        {
            window.alert('hello world');
        }
        
    </script>

when the page is loaded, this code is not executed. Because, the function fn1 is defined. But not called.


<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
    <script>
        function fn1()
        {
            window.alert('hello world');
        }
        
    </script>
</head>
<body>
    This is my web page...
    <input type="button" value="Click me" onclick="fn1()">
</body>
</html>


Look at the above program.
	The button has a click event. that is bound to a function called fn1() now
	so when button is clicked, the function fn1() is called


Data types:
	in javascript, we do not specify the datatype while declaring a variable.
	But the data type is implied from the value we assign into the variable.


{"eid":"1234","fname":"Rama","lname":"Krishna"}
		this is a JSON string
		JavaScript Object Notation


variables in javascript.
Arrays
Objects

if
if else
if elseif else
switch case
while loop
do while loop
for loop
for each loop

all these programming constructs you learned in java language, you can try it in javascript also

While practising, 
	create a function and call that function.

	in that function, practise all these syntax


1) create a html file
2) create a .js file
3) reference the js file from html file
4) create a function
5) call the function in an event
6) inside the function 
	declare variables of various data types
7) display the type of the variable
	change the value and then check the type of variable
8) practise 
	if
if else
if elseif else
switch case
while loop
do while loop
for loop
for each loop	(There is no for each loop syntax in javascript)
	forEach method is there in javascript

Lets learn to access the html elements:
---------------------------------------
HTML Elements can have 
	ID
	NAME
		Attributes


ID
	must be unique across all elements
	<input type="text" id="txt1" name="frm" >
	<input type="text" id="txt2" name="frm" >

In the above example, 
	notice that both the text boxes can have same "NAME" attribute.
	but they cannot have same "ID" attribute. ID must be unique

to get the value of textbox, javascript uses DOM
	Document Object Model
		DOM is an object representation of HTML document or its elements
		DOM treats the entire HTML document as a node. A node that contains all other nodes
		everything is a node in a document tree
		
	to access the value of a textbox, based on ID
		document.getElementById("txt1").value;

	here, document is the object representation of entire html page / document
	document object has methods like
		getElementById()		only one element can be obtained by id. so get Element by id
		getElementsByName()		many elements can have same name. So if you get by name, you get 						Elements.
		both these methods return object representation of the corresponding element
		that element value can be obtained using .value property

		document.getElementById("txt1").value;

	<input type="text" id="txt1" value="Hello world" >

		you understand value is the attribute that contains the value of the element

SCALAR vs CONTAINER elements:
	Text Box
		contains scalar value.	means, single value
	Paragraph
	Div
	select
		These elements do not have single value. They are container that can contain TEXT or HTML content
		These elements have 
			innerHTML		treats html elements and process them and produced output
			innerTEXT		treats <b><i> all/everthing as characters

	

Task:
-----
create a html page with
	textbox
	numeric text box
	radio button
	check box
	drop down list
	and as many type of input elements as possible

	give unique ID for each element

	and access these elements from a javascript function 
	and display their values


Task:
-----
Create a html page that has check boxes.
display all the values selected in the check boxes


In javascript, we can display values in alert message box.
But it is good practise to display in console. 
	for logging or tracing purpose

Right click browser,
	Inspect
		Console



we can declare variables
	globally	(outside any function)
	inside a function
	inside a loop	or block		{}
	
variable names cannot begin with number
	2var		IS INVALID because, a variable name cannot begin with number

cannot be reserved keyword
	void		cannot be a variable name

Operators
	arithmetic operators
	comparison operators
	logical operators
	bitwise operators
	assignment operators
	miscellaneous operators

Task:
	create a html form that accepts following information
	Employee Id
	First Name
	Last Name
	Phone
	Email

on clicking the button,
	javascript function should be called

	that function should create an object of Employee and set the values entered by the user
	display that object in console.

	Hint:
		var employee={"employeeId":"1","firstName":"Rama","lastName":"Krishna","phone":"989898","email":"ram@yahoo.com"};
		employee.employeeId=document.getElementBy....

		console.log(employee);
