Java Date
----------
In Java 8, what are the date options we have?
	java.util.Date
	java.sql.Date
	java.time.LocalDate


Date is a class in util package:
	Date dt=new Date();	
		by default what is the date stored in this object?
			it will store the system date and time.
		Which system?
			in which system it is running, that system date.

		Every date is actually a number		long data type number
		that number keeps increasing every millisecond
		From when?		1970
			Thu Jan 01 05:30:00 IST 1970


How to convert java.util.Date into sql.Date
	java.sql.Date dt1=new java.sql.Date(dt.getTime());
		

LocalDate:
	is introduced in java 8 version
we can do arithmetic on dates easily like
	finding the age of a person
	

		String str="1999-01-01";
		SimpleDateFormat sdf=new SimpleDateFormat("yyyy-MM-dd");
		Date dob1=sdf.parse(str);
		java.sql.Date dob2=new java.sql.Date(dob1.getTime());
		LocalDate dob3 = dob2.toLocalDate();
		
		LocalDate today=LocalDate.now();
		
		System.out.println(dob3);
		System.out.println(today);
		Period result = Period.between(dob3, today);
		System.out.printf("You are %d Years, %d Months and %d days old",result.getYears(),result.getMonths(),result.getDays());


Date
	getTime
	setTime
long number respresenting every millisecond as a long value

Calendar
	GregorianCalendar
		
GregorianCalendar gc=new GregorianCalendar();
		System.out.println(gc.isLeapYear(2024));


SimpleDateFormat
	parse()			converts String into java.util.Date
	format			converst java.util.Date to String

Scanner
	next()				only till the delimiter like SPACE, TAB, NEWLINE
			ideally useful for only one word 
	next().charAt(0)		to get one character as input
	nextLine()			to get input till a new line is found
	nextInt()
	nextFloat()			all these will accept till any delimiter is found	SPACE/TAB/NEWLINE

Process
	Notepad is a program.
	when i run this program, 7 times, at a time, 
	i can see 7 instances in the "Processes" tab of Task Manager.

	Process is a running instance of a program.

	Process contains one or more Threads

Any program you run, (has a main method), then the main method becomes a flow of execution.
	only from main, we branch to other methods.

	Any program, running, has a main thread.

	so far, we have executed many programs, then there was main thread inside those processes

There is no process without a main thread

so far we have created single threaded processes

if we add child threads, which can be started from main thread, then we are creating 
	multi threaded processes


MS Word
	as we are typing, there is 
		auto completion
		auto correction
		word wrap
		spell check utilization

	Threads running inside the process

Resourse
	time and memory

	3 GHz		1/time		3*1024*1024*1024

	For effective utilization of cpu,
		it is better that a process can have more than 1 thread

	bcos, threads do not require separate resource allocation 
	they share the resources allocated for the process

1 thread in a process
	0%
2 threads in a process
	50%
3 threads in a process
	66%
4 threads in a process
	75%


optimal usage of threads is considered


Thread is a class
Runnable interface

a class that implements Runnable interface and override the run() method can be used as a Thread

a class that extends Thread and overrides run() method, is a Thread

Thread


Runnable is a functional interface ie., this interface has only 1 abstract method called run() method
