What are functions?
	is a modular approach
	reusable code
	can be defined once. can be called many times
	
	functions can take arguments (parameters)
		arguments are inputs to the function
	functions can return value/ object
		return value is the output from the function

	we have created functions and we have also mapped these functions to events

	a function can also call another function



question in exam?
	where can you write javascript code?
		head?
		body?
			i would say both "head" and "body"



Javascript event handling
	click
		onclick="fn1()"
	blur				occurs when?	focus is lost. 
	focus				opp to blur	
	keyup
	keydown
	keypress
	mouseover
	

	find out as many events as possible.

Now, 
	how to bind an event to an event handler (function)

	sometimes, directly writing javascript code in event handling
		<input type="button" value="Click here" onclick="alert('hello world')">



	<input type="button" value="CLick me" onclick="fn1()">



<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
    <script>
        function init()
        {
            document.getElementById("btn1").addEventListener("click",fn1);
        }
            

        function fn1()
        {
            alert('This is fn1 called now');
        }

    </script>
</head>
<body onload="init()">
    <!-- <input type="button" value="Click here" onclick="alert('hello world')"> -->
    <!-- <input type="button" value="CLick me" onclick="fn1()"> -->
    <input type="button" id="btn1" value="Click this">
    <script>

    </script>
</body>
</html>




Task:
-----
create few textboxes, when the focus enters a text box, its background color should change to yellow



Cookies:
---------
cookies are always created in clients' computer
key-value pair

username=rama
expires=...date...		(predefined)
path=/			(predefined)			

every cookie belongs to a file/ web page. It is accessible from that page only. 

local storage can be created by one page, and can be accessed from any page

	document.cookie = "username=John Doe";

	document.cookie = "username=John Doe; expires=Thu, 18 Dec 2013 12:00:00 UTC";

	document.cookie = "username=John Doe; expires=Thu, 18 Dec 2013 12:00:00 UTC; path=/";

to delete a cookie, if you give value =""
		or  if you set expires to past date/time

to access a cookie, we can decode a cookie
