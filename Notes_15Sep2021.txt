What are functions?
	is a modular approach
	reusable code
	can be defined once. can be called many times
	
	functions can take arguments (parameters)
		arguments are inputs to the function
	functions can return value/ object
		return value is the output from the function

	we have created functions and we have also mapped these functions to events

	a function can also call another function



question in exam?
	where can you write javascript code?
		head?
		body?
			i would say both "head" and "body"
