What is the return type of 
	sc.next();	?????
----------------


in a linked list, i am going to add

list.add(200);
list.add(100);
list.add(300);

what will be order??????

--------------------
Collections.reverse()
	please check this method
	and its signature
--------------------------

what will the get() method return when key is not found?
	map.get(key);		//key is not found


ArrayList have indexOf method
	what will be the index of first element?

so if element is not found?

------------

sort method belongs to???
	Arrays
	Collections



ArrayList.sort()		is NOT CORRECT

can we call the run method directly 

Thread
	run()

.start()
.run()

both are correct

how can we remove an element from a tree set?

not while looping. Just remove by value

void display(int []...x)
{
}

What is x?

x is a param array
x is a variable length argument

... is called ellipsis (spelling may not be correct)

Collections class has "binarySearch" method

To make a method as "Thread safe",
we can also declare the method as "static"


wait()
	method of thread
		waits until "notify" or "notifyAll" method is used.
	sometimes, we can give timing 
wait(1000)
	once the time lapsed, the thread will continue
	before that time lapse, if notify/ nofiyAll is called, then also the thread will continue

start()
yield()
join()
sleep()
	which of these methods, can you call using 
	Thread.
t1.start();		object.start() NOT Thread.start() what will it start? object has method
Thread.start() is WRONG

Thread.yield() is correct. Because, it is not specific to a Thread object.

whoever is owner of monitor should give up and next random thread is allocated the monitor.

Checked exception

Exception classes hierarchy

	FileNotFoundException extends IOException

if we handle IOException, then it will also handle
	FileNotFoundException

suppose, if you give array index as -1, then
	compile time or run time error?
compile time, checking checks if a number is used in index or not. Thats all. 

but only at runtime, it will use that index to access the element, and gets error at rutime
